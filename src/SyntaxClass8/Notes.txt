============================Selenium Class 8==========================
Window handles():
Each window/tab has unique Id

How do we handle multiple windows in Selenium:
1. getAllWindowHandles()--> gets all the handles-->return type:set of strings
2. driver.switchTo.windows(desiered windowHandle)

getWindowHandles()-->this method is not taking care

only 1 window at a time


==============================Waits======================
1.ImplicitWait
-is applied to all "driver.findElement"
 if the element is found , no wait is applied
 if it is not found then the wait is applied for certain amount of time
 *if the certain amount of time has passed and still the emelent is not found, we get an Exeption "noSuchElement"

 Syntax for this wait is:
 driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait();

 implicitwait(maximum amount of time before it throws an exception, units)
 ********************************Implicit wait - waits till the webelement is found

2.ExplicitWait or WebDriver waits
These waits are used to tell the webdriver to wait till the certain condition is matched
