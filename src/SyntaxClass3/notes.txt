why do we need XPATH locator?
-developers may not have provided other locators in html
-by using xpath we can identify those webelements easily

what is an Xpath?
Xpath is just like a query language that helps you to identify elements

types of xpath:
1. Absolute xpath-- starts with a starting node in html  starts with a single slash (/) ... also copy element code and select fullxpath

2. Relative xpath --
syntax:
//tagname[@attribute='attribute name']

//input[@id='pass']

identify the element by its text:
//tagname[text()='text value']

identifying elements using contain method
//tagname[contains(@attribute,'attribute value')]
