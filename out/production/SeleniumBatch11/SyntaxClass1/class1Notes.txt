What is Software testing?
- Identify the quality and correctness of the software

How many ways can we test a software?
- manual
- automation

when do we go for automation?
- frequent regression testing is required
- repeated test case execution
- efficiency

What are the tools that we have for automation?
SELENIUM, UFT/QTP, CUCUMBER, TestNG, Katlon Studio

Levels of testing?
1. Unit testing
2. Integration testing
3. System testing
4. Acceptance testing

Types if Testing?
1. Functional ()
2. Non-Functional (performance, security)

What is Selenium?
-A set of tools to help us automate
Web based applications only     ---no desktop aplications
Performing functional testing
It is usually used for performance Testing


Selenium suite. . .
1.SELENIUM IDE- it is a plugin, record and play
cons: no programming

2.SELENIUM RC- remote control
- it supports different languages
- it supports different browsers
- it requires RC server


3.SELENIUM WEBDRIVER --- its an interface
- support different browsers
- it will support different languages

4.SELeNIUM GRID
- consists of a node and hub
- run test cases in parallel on a different browsers

Selenium 1
Selenium 2---> Selenium RC and webDriver(combined)
selenium 3---> some improvements in Selenium2
Selenium4---> Some changes and improvements in the communication protocol

Advantages of Selenium
- Open source (for free)
- Compatible with different languages( java,ruby, C#)
- It allows you to have test cases run on different browsers
- It's not OS dependent (windows , Mac, Linux)

Disadvantages of Selenium
-no technical support
-we cannot test desktop application
-no built-in reports
-we cannot test images and videos

Selenium Architecture
JSON (Java script object notation)-WIRE PROTOCOL



STEPS TI OPNE CHROME USING SELENIUM
1. Set System Property (key,value) -key is the driver that we are using ---value is the path to that driver
2. Create an object
3.
--------- close() vs quit()
driver.close()-----> it will close the current tab that we are on

driver.quit()-----> it will close the whole browser
---------

-----------get() vs navigate()
-using navigate we can move forward and backwards and refresh the page
 but
using get we cannot do that


--all website are made of usually HTML,CSS and js

we have tags in HTML
-tags have different purposes ...to define headings,paragraphs, pictures etc
we must have an opening tag and closing tag

example:
<html> -- its an opening tag (or node)
</html> -- its closing tags

<batch11>
  <listOfStudents>
    <name>Lubo</name>
    <name>Miska</name> (attribute and the value is that attribute)
  </listOfStudents>
  <listOfInstructors>
    <name>Moazzam</name>
    <name>Asghar</name>
  </listOfInstructors>
</batch11>

another example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Batch 11 </h1>
<p>Our first class isn't looking too bad for now.
First time im really enjoying this :)</p>

</body>
</html>


//html

<tag attribute>
</tag>


the webpage has an underlying html code
---everything that we see on the webpage is basically appearing to us thorough some kind of code
DOM-->Document Object Model (Inspect on every page)

WeBElement :
everything that appears to us on any webpage (behind every webElements we have underlying html code (text box,check box,radio buttons,web tables,buttons,links, broken links-images)

Locator:
it is the address or the position of the WebElement on the page

*8 Locators :
1. id    ----is the safest and quickest locator used
2. name
3. Tagname
4. classname
5. linktext
6. partiallinktext
7. xpath
8. css

why do we have so many locators:
if the locator is not unique, we can choose the one that is unique
-the developers may not provide us with all the locators

When do we get a noElement exception?
Selenium was unable to find the element that we are looking for
GO CHECK YOUR LOCATOR VALUE

<a> is called an anchor tag, it contains a link
we can access this using locator "linktext or partiallink"

a webElement has an underlying code
-his html code starts with a tag
-the tag may have different attributes
-there attributes are there to help locate those elements and in some cases define the other criterias
-we must make sure that the locator that we are opting for is unique enough
-
what if there are 2 attributes with same values - selenium is going to return the first one
